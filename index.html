		MIND is a card game where participating <a href="/story.html#thinkers">Thinkers</a> battle it out in the <a href="/story.html#reverie">Reverie</a> using powerful Thought and Intellect cards. It can be played <strong>competitively or cooperatively</strong> against other players or boss-like creatures called <a href="/story.html#cerebrals">Cerebrals</a>.
	</p>
	<p>MIND is unique in it's approach to its theme as it focuses on <strong>heavy player customization</strong> and user generated content. This web-app allows you to <a href="/create.html"><strong>create your own cards</strong></a> and explore your imagination with the card generator.</p>


	<h2 id="theGoal">The goal <a href="#theGoal"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>You are a <strong>Thinker</strong> who uses <strong>Thought</strong> and <strong>Intellect</strong> cards to break your opponent’s <strong>Focus Counters</strong>.</p>
	<p>In a standard game of MIND, players begin with three Focus Counters. Players then take turns trying to break their opponent's Focus while defending their own. The game ends when there is only one Thinker with Focus Counters left.</p>
	<p>There are two ways you can break your opponent's Focus counters:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Engaging</strong> a Thinker directly with your Thought cards.</li>
		<li>Forcing a Thinker to run out of cards.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="thinkers">Thinkers <a href="#thinkers"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p><a href="/story.html#thinkers">Thinker</a> cards represent the player and are played at the beginning of the each game.</p>
	<p><img src="/images/MIND-Thinker-Card.png" alt="Picture of MIND Thinker card"></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Memory:</strong> limit of card cost you may have in play at once.</li>
		<li><strong>Break:</strong> a direct engagement must have a higher total Power than this to break a Focus Counter.</li>
		<li><strong>Effect:</strong> a Thinker’s special ability that is active during the entirety of the game.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts <a href="#thoughts"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>Thoughts are formations of mental objects that stay on the field and help you overcome your opponent.</p>
	<p><img src="/images/MIND-Thought-Card.png" alt="Picture of MIND Thought Card"></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> amount of Memory required to play and keep this card in play.</li>
		<li><strong>Power:</strong> base potency of a Thought.</li>
		<li><strong>Effect:</strong> special rules for the Thought.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="intellects">Intellects <a href="#intellects"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>Intellects are mental abilities that can be played at any time during any turn.</p>
	<p><img src="/images/MIND-Intellect-Card.png" alt="Picture of MIND Intellect Card"></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> amount of Memory required to play or keep this card in play.</li>
		<li><strong>Effect:</strong> special effect granted when the card is played.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2 id="startingAGame">Starting a game <a href="#startingAGame"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>For a standard MIND match, two players pit their deck of 21 cards against one another. Decks are comprised of 20 unique cards and a single Thinker card. Having multiple copies of the same card effect is not allowed and each card must have a unique name.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Place your Thinker Card in front of you.</li>
		<li>Shuffle your deck.</li>
		<li>Decide who will go first at random.</li>
		<li>Draw 5 cards.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's all, you're now ready to begin.</p>


	<h2 id="stepsOfATurn">Steps of a turn <a href="#stepsOfATurn"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>Your turn is divided up into 6 steps that are always taken in order.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Disengage:</strong> rotate  your Engaged cards to show they are ready to be used again
	.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Discard:</strong> you may send any number of cards you own, in play or in your hand, to the discard pile.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Draw:</strong> draw from your deck  until you have 5 cards in your hand
	</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Play:</strong> you may play Thoughts from your hand and Group them as you please.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Engage:</strong> you may attempt to break enemy Thoughts or Focus Counters by engaging them.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>End:</strong> declare the end of your turn.</strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Disengaged-Engaged.png" alt="Picture of MIND Thought Card both Disengaged and Engaged"></p>

	<h2 id="onYourFirstTurn">On your first turn <a href="#onYourFirstTurn"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>The game setup is considered a separate process from taking a turn. So, even on your first turn you may choose to discard any number of cards in your hand and draw until you have 5 cards.</p>
	<p>All players skip the Engage step until everyone has had a chance to play Thoughts.</p>

	<h2 id="runingOutOfCardsToDraw">Running out of cards to draw <a href="#runingOutOfCardsToDraw"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>If you do not have enough cards left to draw on your turn, destroy one of your Focus Counters, and shuffle your discard pile and place it into play as your deck.</p>
	<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be careful when discarding too many cards! Runing out of cards will break one of your Focus Counters.</p>

	<h2 id="playingThoughts">Playing Thoughts <a href="#playingThoughts"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>Thoughts can only be played from your hand on your turn. As long as you don't exceed your Memory, you may play any number of Thoughts from your hand. While a card is in play, its <strong>Cost</strong> is deducted from your total available <strong>Memory</strong>.</p>
	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Memory.png" alt="Picture of MIND card memory sum"></p>

	<h2 id="thinkerOverload">Thinker Overload <a href="#thinkerOverload"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>Sometimes, an Effect will cause you to have more cards in play than you can afford. When this happens, immediately remove cards, of your choice, until the total Cost of all of your cards in play does not exceed your Memory.</p>

	<h2 id="groupingThoughts">Grouping Thoughts <a href="#groupingThoughts"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>During your Play step, you may group, ungroup, or regroup your Disengaged Thoughts in play. Grouping allows your Thoughts to challenge as a single unit with a combined Power.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Grouped Thoughts are considered a single target.</p>

	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Grouping.png" alt="Picture of MIND card memory sum"></p>

	<h2 id="engagingYourOpponent">Engaging your opponent <a href="#engagingYourOpponent"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>You can declare an engagement  to either:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove opposing Thoughts or Groups in play.</li>
		<li>Break your opponent's Focus counters.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You’ll need a Disengaged Thought or Group to declare an engagement. An engagement is made up of three steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Rotate a Disengaged Thought or Group.</li>
		<li>Declare the target of the engagement, that can be an opposing Thought, Group, or Thinker.</li>
		<li>Resolve the challenge by figuring out who won the challenge.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You can engage as many disengaged Thoughts or Groups under your control. If your cards were not removed, they remain engaged until your next  Disengage step.</p>

	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Engagement.png" alt="Picture of MIND card memory sum"></p>


	<h3 id="resolvingAnEngagement">Resolving an Engagement <a href="#resolvingAnEngagement"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>Figuring out who won an Engagement is slightly different depending on your target.</p>
	<p><strong>When engaging another Thought or Group:</strong> The Thought or Group with the highest total Power wins. The loser is removed and sent to the discard pile. In the case of a draw, both are removed and sent to the discard pile.</p>
	<p><strong>When engaging a Thinker directly:</strong> If the total Power of your challenge is higher than the Break point, remove one Focus counter, otherwise nothing happens.</p>

	<h3 id="blockingAnEngagement">Blocking an Engagement <a href="#blockingAnEngagement"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>After the target of an engagement has been declared, you may choose to block with a Disengaged Thought or Group . To declare a Block, Engage a Thought or Group by rotating the card. The challenge is then redirected to the blocker.</p>

	<h3 id="missing">Missing <a href="#missing"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>When the target of an engagement is removed the challenge misses. When a challenge misses its outcome is negated and the challenger(s) remain Engaged.</p>

	<h2 id="playingIntellects">Playing Intellects <a href="#playingIntellects"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>Intellects can be played at any time during any turn. The intellect last played gets resolved first. Intellects stay in play until their effect is resolved.</p>

	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Playing-Intellects.png" alt="Picture of MIND card memory sum"></p>

	<h3 id="intellectScope">Intellect Scope <a href="#intellectScope"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>The Intellect’s effect will define how long the card stays in play, this is called Scope.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Continuous:</strong> ongoing until the card is removed.</li>
		<li><strong>Temporary:</strong> until the end of this turn or until the card is removed.</li>
		<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> resolved right away and then removed from play.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Intellect-Scope.png" alt="Picture of MIND card memory sum"></p>

	<h2 id="gameplayModes">Gameplay Modes <a href="#gameplayModes"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>MIND can be played with any number of players, even just one. You can play a solo game versus a <strong>Cerebral deck</strong>, have team battles, or free-for-alls.</p>
	
	<h3 id="freeForAll">Free-for-all <a href="#freeForAll"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>Free-for-alls can be played with two or more players and is the standard way to play.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Each player begins the game with three Focus Counters.</li>
		<li>You may alter the amount of Focus Counters each player begins with to make games shorter or longer.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>To shorten games with many players, start each Thinker with less Focus Counters.</p>

	<h3 id="teamPLay">Team Play <a href="#teamPLay"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>Team battles can be played with an even number of players, this game mode plays just like a free-for-all game with a few exceptions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The entire team shares a single set of Focus counters.</li>
		<li>Each team starts with one Focus counter per player in their team.</li>
		<li>The turn order alternates between teams and its players.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="teamPLayTurnOrderExample">>Turn order example: <a href="#teamPLayTurnOrderExample"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h4>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Team A:</strong> player 1 of Team A takes his turn.</li>
		<li><strong>Team B:</strong> player 1 of Team B  takes his turn.</li>
		<li><strong>Team A:</strong> player 2 of Team A takes his turn.</li>
		<li><strong>Team B:</strong> player 2  of Team B takes his turn.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="cerebrals">Cerebrals <a href="#cerebrals"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>MIND can be played cooperatively, or solitarily,  against a special kind of deck called a <a href="/story.html#cerebrals">Cerebral</a>. Cerebrals are insentient culminations of feeling that have become so powerful they have a life of their own. Playing with more than one player against the Cerebral is considered "team play",  all players share the same pool of counters.</p>
	
	<h3 id="cerebralSetup">Setup <a href="#cerebralSetup"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>To begin a Cerebral game you’ll need a Cerebral deck. This deck consist of one Cerebral card, at least three Ability Cards, and a deck of any number of Effect cards. The object of the game is to defeat the Cerebral by destroying all of its Focus counters.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Play the Cerebral card.</li>
		<li>At random, choose 2 + P number of Ability cards and play them, then remove the rest from the game. To modify difficulty, alter the number of Ability cards the Cerebral begins with.</li>
		<li>Shuffle and play the deck of effect cards.</li>
		<li>Give the Cerebral 2 + P number of Focus Counters where P represents the number of Players. To modify difficulty, alter the number of Focus Counters the Cerebral begins with.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Thinkers may choose to make either the Cerebral or its Ability cards the target of their engagements.</p>

	<p><img class="img-block" src="/images/MIND-Cerebral-Setup.png" alt="Picture of MIND card memory sum"></p>

	<h3 id="typesOfCerebralCards">Types of Cerebral Cards <a href="#typesOfCerebralCards"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>There are three different types of cards that make up a Cerebral deck:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Cerebral cards</strong> are played in the beginning of the game, you must engage it with a power higher than its power in order to break a focus counter.</li>
		<li><strong>Ability cards</strong> are also played in the beginning of the game, they can be removed by engaging them with a power higher than its Break point.</li>
		<li><strong>Effect cards</strong> are played giving the Cerebral huge advantages, making them hard to defeat.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="stepsOfACerebralsTurn">Steps of a Cerebrals Turn <a href="#stepsOfACerebralsTurn"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>At the end of each players turn, these  additional steps are taken:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Flip over an effect card from the Cerebral effect deck and play it.</li>
		<li>The Cerebral launches an engagement targeting the Thinker directly whose turn it is.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Unlike Thought cards, Cerebrals are not rotated after an engagement.</p>

	<h3 id="runningOutOfCerebralEffectCards">Running out of Effect Cards <a href="#runningOutOfCerebralEffectCards"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h3>
	<p>When the Cerebral has depleted its deck of effect cards, simply reshuffle the discard pile of effects into a deck and play it. Unlike Thinkers, a Cerebral does not lose a focus counter when it depletes its Effect deck.</p>
