		Bring thoughts into reality and overpower your opponents. MIND challenges the greatest imaginations from every corner of the globe to compete in a battle of focus and intellect.
	</p>
	<p>Mankind exists as a very diverse and dynamic race. We are successful because of our intelligence, fearsome because of our ingenuity, beautiful for our arts, and unique because of our cultures. From tribes of tens to expansive cities of millions across thousands of years and thousands of kilometers, our cultures have pervaded the globe. Varied ethnicities have grown, some have stayed, and others have gone. Yet one aspect is always present, the moral compass. </p>
	
	<p>Man is always predisposed, driven even, towards righteousness, kindness, and beneficence. Anthropologists, ethologists, and sociobiologists have long discussed the advent of morality, toiling to devise a meaningful hypotheses that succinctly describes our tendency towards righteousness. What they do not know, what they could not know, is that we are all connected on a subconscious level. Only gifted, or cursed, individuals understand truly why your friend’s bad attitude rubs off on you.</p>

	<h2 id="reverie">The Reverie <a href="#reverie"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>

	<p>Human conscience forms an interconnected web of emotional cognition. Many thinkers liken the Reverie to what they used to experience in their dreams only now it has the depth of seven billion souls represented in a realm vast beyond comprehension. A place where anything exists.</p>

	<p>Both beautiful and dangerous the Reverie is known to overwhelm Thinkers. It is understood that staying too long within the Reverie can have adverse effects on mental stability.</p>

	<p>The plane is always subject to the whims of the masses. Human subconsciousness gives form to the Reverie. Thinkers often seek a bastion formed primarily of a safe thought or emotion for their ventures into the Reverie. Very strong and multitudinous feelings may cause bleed over between bastions or even massive reformation to the mindscape.</p>

	<h2 id="thinkers">Thinkers <a href="#thinkers"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>Thinkers are gifted individuals who gain access to the Reverie. A thinker has a capacity to manipulate the Reverie by conjuring thoughts into subsistence. Maintaining these conjured thoughts is taxing.</p>
	
	<p>Tampering with the Reverie is highly controversial between Thinkers. Changing things within the Reverie may alter perspectives of individuals without. This has given rise to conflict between Thinkers that do not share opinions.</p>
	
	<p>Thinker versus thinker combat within the Reverie is commonplace. Some thinkers have taken to sporting duels, some to forceful application of their opinions, and others still to defending the sanctity of the Reverie. No matter what the purpose Thinkers have devised a plethora of techniques for defeating their rivals.</p>

	<h2 id="cerebrals">Cerebrals <a href="#cerebrals"><span class="wl-hash">#</span></a></h2>
	<p>Cerebrals are seemingly insentient entities composed of the base elements of human feeling. These Anomalous conjurations have the sole itinerary of consuming the Reverie. Cerebrals exist for both positive and negative feeling.</p>

	<p>Drawing near a Cerebral floods an approaching Thinker with its associated feeling. It takes extreme focus to ignore the presence of a Cerebral and its effect upon the mind. Some Thinkers seek out Cerebrals specifically to experience the feeling emanated by its proximity.</p>

	<p>Thinkers understand that Cerebrals are a manifestation of deep human experience. Any Cerebral’s grasp on the Reverie is directly proportional to the state of human feeling as a whole. Inversely, helping or hampering a Cerebral may alter the perspectives of millions of individuals. It is feared that large imbalances introduced into the Reverie may have catastrophic results amongst humankind.</p>
