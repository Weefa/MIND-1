MIND
====
**MIND** is a card game where participating **Thinkers** battle it out using powerful **Thought** and **Intellect** cards. It can be played competitively or cooperatively against other players or boss-like creatures called **Cerebrals**.

MIND is unique in it's approach to its theme as it focuses on **heavy player customization** and user generated content. This web-app allows players to **create their own cards** and explore their imaginations with the card generators.
